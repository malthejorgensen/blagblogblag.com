title: Tools I use
---
On this page I list a bunch of (developer) tools I enjoy using in my work and
elsewhere.

## Website monitoring (uptime)
**webcron** is cheap, and sends texts (SMSs) when your website goes down. It
even sends texts to Denmark where I live! This is nice if you run websites for
clients or websites that a lot of people use. ([Link][webcron])

_Alternatives_: [Pingdom] (expensive, but industry leader), [UptimeRobot] (free and
I really like it, but doesn't send texts to Denmark), [monitor.us] (free, sends
weekly statistics (uptime percentage), but doesn't send texts)

[monitor.us]: http://www.monitor.us/

## Continous integration (git hooks)
**drone.io** is free, integrates with Github, and has simple and intuitive
interface. Doesn't have all the bells and whistles, but I don't need those so
drone.io is just perfect for me. ([Link](http://drone.io))

_Alternatives_: [TravisCI] (a cross between Jenkins and drone.io -- more
advanced, slick UI, but I never tried it), [Jenkins] (free, open source tool
but I don't get the interface and you have to host yourself)

[Jenkins]: http://jenkins-ci.org/
