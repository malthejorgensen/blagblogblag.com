title: Buying things online (scams)
---

Long story short: _[bosto-tablet.com] is a great, legimate seller of Bosto
drawing tablets. I bought a Kingtee 19-mb from the site and it was delivered
within days of my purchase, and I am very happy with the product. However before
I bought something off the site I was worried that it was a scam. This is a
story of worry, research and a leap of faith._

So I was planning to buy a drawing tablet, like [the ones from Wacom](https://www.wacom.com/products/pen-displays/cintiq/cintiq-13hd).
However, after researching a little I found out that today (as opposed to a
    couple of years ago when I last checked) cheaper are alternatives available –
possibly because some of Wacom's patents have expired. These alternatives are
made by two companies called Yiynova and Bosto. After reading some reviews and
viewing a lot of videos demonstrating the tablets I decided to go for the
_Bosto kingtee 19-mb_.

But I needed it shipped to Denmark at a reasonable price – so where was I going
to get that? I found [bosto-tablet.com] which looks quite nice. But the site
isn't really mentioned anywhere on the net – so how could I know that it was run
by the manufacturer or a legitimate reseller? That it wasn't a scam?

The site is very plain, and doesn't really give a lot of information, about who
runs the shop and where it's located.  The site also has a list of recent
customers with date of purchase and model number.
(At the time the table didn't show the DHL tracking as it does now)  
If you're already suspicious of the site this list comes off as a baiting device,
as you don't normally see such lists on larger webshops.
The list is basically yelling: "_Hey look, we're legit – just go ahead and buy
something already!_", which is coincidentally also what you would want to do if
you were luring people into a scam.

[bosto-tablet.com]: https://bosto-tablet.com

So I decided to probe a little further. The site presents the mail
`info@bosto-tablet.com` to which I wrote:

> Hi Bosto
> 
> Do you ship to Denmark?
> 
> -- Malthe

Perhaps I would get a badly written response? (as per the usual spam email, which would indicate a scam)

I got the reply:

> Malthe, we ship to Denmark. It's free. Have a good buy
> 
> \-\-  
> Sincerely yours, Andrey Belkov, Bosto

Now Bosto is a Chinese company, so it was weird that someone with a russian
sounding name responded. The response itself is well-written and short,
basically what I would expect from a modern web company. Not from a
Chinese tablet manufacturer. This well-written short response could
just be luring me further into a possible scam…

Well, in the end I decided to go for it anyway and I was able to track my
package via DHL on its 3-day journey from Hong Kong to Copenhagen (Denmark). I
recieved the package 6 days after my Paypal payment.

![Bosto PayPal vendor info](img/bosto-paypal.png)

The PayPal vendor information was kinda funny (you can see it on the left).
Obviously Chinese symbols aren't allowed in email addresses and Chinese people
often choose an English name to ease communication with English-speaking
countries hence the "roger". At least that's my guess as to why the email is
what it is.
_Forhandleroplysninger_ means _Seller info_ in danish. (Displayed as _Merchant_ in english Paypal)

**Now, how do you know this blog post isn't part of the scam?** ^^

Possible solutions
------------------
Of course there should be and _are_ sites and services that keep track of
whether vendors are real and can be trusted. None of the ones mentioned here
had a review of bosto-tablet.com at the time of writing.

#### Sites

- [ResellerRatings](https://resellerratings.com) even though they earn money by 
  making the vendors pay to contact users on the site (to respond to any 
  critique) the site is still riddled with ads.
- [TrustPilot](https://trustpilot.com) has the same as business model as 
  ResellerRatings but without ads. Being a newer, originally Danish, site it 
  doesn't have the volume ResellerRatings has (yet), but it is better. They have
  some problems with fake reviews, though I guess any site of this sort will.
  It's a very important caveat and they really should work hard to come up with
  a good solution.

#### Browser plugins
Having such a service available as a browser plugin is a very good idea. It saves
you the time of looking up the vendor – it's available right in the browser.
Futhermore the instant availability of the plugin makes it easy to review sites
and could possibly mean that more sites get rated than on sites such as
TrustPilot.

  - [WOT](https://www.mywot.com/) tried it, and it worked very nicely.
  - [websherpa](https://websherpa.me) another browser plugin, didn't test it.
