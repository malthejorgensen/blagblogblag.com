It easy to guess what this function does – but a guess is **only** a guess.
Software isn't and shouldn't be a guessing game.  The only way for an outside
programmer to know what the function is **supposed** to be doing is through
documentation. If a programmer reads the code, as I did, he will know what the
function _does_, but that might not be what the _intention_ of the function was
– a bug in the code, that is undiscoverable by outside programmers as the right
behaviour of the function is undocumented and therefore undefined -- to outside
programmers at the very least.
