If you have a "Single Page App"

Services like [Blitz.io] don't let easily grab all the files a user hitting your
site would request.

Open Developer Tools, go to the Network pane, right-click and hit
_Save as HAR with content_.

This saves a rather hefty JSON file (with the extension `.har`). We just need
the URLs.

We can get those "easily" (you might think my way is rather cumbersome):

1. Install [jq] (on OS X `brew install jq`)
2. Grab the `url` property from the entries in the JSON file

    jq '[.log.entries[].request.url | .]' example.org.har | grep 'example.org'

  Here we grab the `url` property of the request property of every element in
  the `entries` (array) property of the `log` property of the root element in the
  JSON document.

  I encourage you to play around with `jq` -- it's quite cool, although I don't
  know how often it's really practical to use.

  Note, to be more "correct" we could ensure that only `GET` requests are
  reprouced:

    jq '[.log.entries[].request | select(.method == "GET") | .url]' example.org.har

<!--
  Bleeding edge maniacs (using jq version 1.5) should be able to do this:

    jq '[.log.entries[].request | select(.method == "GET") | .url | test("https?:\/\/example\.org")]' example.org.har
-->

Now we have the of URLs the user will hit when reaching the front page of our
site.

1. Install `ruby-jmeter`

       gem install ruby-jmeter
