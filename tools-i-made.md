On this page I list a bunch of (developer) tools I enjoy using in my work and
elsewhere.

## repx ([link](https://github.com/malthejorgensen/repx))
repx is to sed, what awk is grep.

Yes yes, I'm old now and sd and rg exist, but they didn't back then!

_repx was previously named prex, but has been renamed due to a pre-existing
package in PyPI called prex._

## janus
A version of `jq` that I can understand.

## difftree ([link](https://github.com/malthejorgensen/difftree))
Easily get a small overview of what changed between two folders.

UNIX's `diff -qr` can also do this to some extent.
Alternately, `rsync --dry-run -c -r -v`.

_difftree was previously named dirdiff, but has been renamed due to a pre-existing
package in PyPI called dirdiff._
