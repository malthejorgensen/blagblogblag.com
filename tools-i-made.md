title: Tools I made
---
On this page I list a bunch of (developer) tools I enjoy using in my work and
elsewhere.

## prex
prex is to sed, what awk is grep.

Yes yes, I'm old now and sd and rg exist, but they didn't back then!

## janus
A version of `jq` that I can understand.

## dirdiff
Easily get a small overview of what changed between two folders.

UNIX's `diff -qr` can also do this to some extent.
Alternately, `rsync --dry-run -c -r -v`.
